# SAMP-Server-Discord-Bot
This script HEAVILY relies on the database of the server. Make sure you make it compatible with your database structure. I recommend you to plug your backup database in this bot script. You need NodeJS with DiscordJS framework and MySQL. To start the bot simply open up powershell/cmd prompt in the bot folder and type 'node index.js'. 'botconfig.json' contains the token and the prefix of your bot.
Feel free to edit.
Script is from abandoned project for Lawless Roleplay.
